## Colab Project
### Overview
This project implements an end-to-end image classification pipeline for categorizing consumer products into makeup, skincare, and scents using a lightweight convolutional neural network. The focus is on building a reproducible PyTorch system that can be deployed for real-time inference on resource-constrained devices.
### Issue
The task is formulated as a single-label, multi-class classification problem. It was divided into three categories: skincare, makeup, and scents. It's common for models to get confused due to simple minimalistic packaging. The images from the dataset were hand-picked to show similarities in boxes, lids, minimalistic designing, etc.
